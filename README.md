# API Documentation

#### Backend deployed at [Heroku]:

(https://key-conservation.herokuapp.com/) (Production Server)<br>
(https://key-conservation-staging.herokuapp.com/) (Staging Server)<br>

## Build Instructions
Feel free to use `yarn ...` instead of `npm run ...`, but make sure not to commit the `yarn.lock`.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/key-conservation-be`.
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd key-conservation-be`.
3. Install PostgreSQL. See [installation instructions below](#installing-postgres).
4. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`. For Windows users, see [specific build instructions below](#windows-build-instructions).
5. Create a new `.env` file using `.env.example` as a template: `cp .env.example .env`.
6. Fill out the `.env`. See the [example file below](#sample-env).
7. Run the containerized service(s) (e.g. Postgres): `docker-compose up -d`.
8. Initialize the database: `npm run db:migrate`.
9. Seed the database: `npm run db:seed`.
10. Start the Node app: `npm run server`.

#### Installing Postgres
MacOS and Linux users can install Postgres via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), and Linux users can use `apt`. Windows users will need to download the Postgres 11.5 installer from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/), run the installer, and add the Postgres bin to the PATH environment variable.

#### Windows Build Instructions
1. Run the Windows Powershell as administrator.
2. Install build tools to compile [native Node modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools#examples-of-modules-supported): `npm install -g windows-build-tools`.
3. Rerun `npm install` in a separate command prompt window.

#### Sample `.env`
```
AIRTABLE_KEY=
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=keycons_dev
DATABASE_PASS=password
DATABASE_NAME=key-conservation
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
S3_BUCKET_NAME=
S3_BUCKET_REGION=
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
SWT_SECRET=secret
```
**Note**: For Windows users, `localhost` won't work&mdash;you'll need to set `DATABASE_HOST` to [the Docker Machine's IP address](https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/ip/).

#### Useful Commands
+ `docker-compose up -d` to configure and run any required services
+ `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
+ `npm run server` to run the Node app with [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
+ `npm run lint` to lint the Node app with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (without `--fix`)
+ `npm run lint:fix` to handle the simple linter issues automatically
+ `npm run test` to run the test suite with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
+ `npm run db:migrate` to run any new database migrations
+ `npm run db:seed` to add some fake data to the database
+ `docker exec -it pg.keycons.local psql -U [DATABASE_USER] -d [DATABASE_NAME]` to access Postgres.

Take a look at [`package.json`](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/key-conservation-be/blob/master/package.json) for the actual commands.

## Endpoints

## Data Model

#### Airtable Key Access

The airtable key is stored in the config vars in heroku. To keep it secret in the front end, we access the key through a get request. The endpoint is /api/airtable, and the route is found in airtableRouter in the airtable-key-retrieval directory.
