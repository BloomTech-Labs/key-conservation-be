            'As a group, raptors exhibit an extraordinary variety of hunting techniques. Aside from owls (which are sometimes considered raptors) almost all are diurnal hunters, but a few like the European Hobby (a smaller relative of the Peregrine) will pounce on mice in the moonlight. Some are like the Peregrine in that they hunt at high speed. The Sharp-shinned Hawk, for example, often flashes through relatively thick woodland, maneuvering skillfully and often snatching passerines right from their perches. Others, like American Kestrels, Black-shouldered Kites, and the young of the very successful Red-tailed Hawk, often hover when hunting, and then drop steeply down on their targets. \n\nAnd still others, including adult Red-tails, soar as they watch for prey on the ground. But most hunting by raptors probably is done from perches with a commanding view from which the bird can scan the surrounding terrain with its telescope-like vision, where it can glide rapidly to gather in its prey. Interestingly, whether an American Kestrel hovers or perch-hunts depends in large part on whether there is a good breeze to hover in. \n\nWhichever technique is used, most prey of raptors are killed by the talons of the contracting foot being driven into their bodies; if required, the hooked bill is used to give a coup-de-grace. \n\nThe exceptions are falcons, which ordinarily kill by biting into the necks of victims not dispatched in mid-air. (Owls also bite the necks of their prey.)',
